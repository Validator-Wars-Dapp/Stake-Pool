This file lists the dependencies of the "solido" command-line program, and their
licenses. An up to date list can be generated with

    cargo license --manifest-path cli/Cargo.toml --avoid-dev-deps --avoid-build-deps

Solido itself is licensed under the GNU Public License version 3. The situation
for "ring" is more subtle, see its license file at [1] (this is a permalink).
For the other libraries, you can look up the license text itself by identifier
at the SPDX website [2]. Most of these licenses are also present in the
/usr/share/common-licenses directory of the container image.

[1]: https://github.com/briansmith/ring/blob/1bf024dacfeb38eef7400b7880f46af5620cab42/LICENSE
[2]: https://spdx.org/licenses/

This file is automatically extended with the license list when bundled in the
container image; in the repository it is only the template.
